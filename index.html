            <h2>What does a term ‘fruit’ mean?</h2>
            <p>The term fruit can have different meanings. In botanical biology a fruit is the ripened ovary of a flowering plant, which contains the seeds. Plants use fruits to disseminate their seeds. But when we talk about fruits as food, we limit ourselves to those fruits that are sweet and fleshy. Mango, apple, cherries, and oranges are always considered fruits, they are botanically fruits, but at the same time they are also culinary fruits. But beans and cucumbers are fruits only in a botanical sense; as food we call them vegetables and not fruits. But the difference between vegetables and fruits is sometimes also rather confusing: some fruits, such as tomato and avocado, can be considered a culinary fruit but they are at the same time eaten as a vegetable.</p>

            <h2>What makes a fruit tropical?</h2>
            <p>Strictly speaking the word tropical refers to the tropics, which is the area of earth centered on the equator and limited in the North by the Tropic of Cancer and in the south by the Tropic of Capricorn. This tropical zone stretches from 23.4 º North latitude to 23.4 º South latitude. Tropical fruits are those that have their origin in the tropics and require a rather tropical or subtropical climate; they don't tolerate frost.Other fruits are the rest, which usually grow in more temperate climates. The distinction is not very accurate. Some tropical fruits are also grown in warmer areas outside the tropics, while many of the temperate fruits can also be found in the tropics, especially in cooler mountain or hill areas.</p>

            <h3>About the project:</h3>
            <p>In the past year or so, responsive web design has become the leading technique for building sites that work well on phones and tablets, as well as on desktop computers.<br/>
            Building a responsive site adds new challenges for web designers and developers. You need to consider how columns shrink and shift as the screen size changes, as well as how images are scaled. User interface components such as navigation bars, tabs, and carousels must also adapt to varying screen sizes. <br/>Fortunately, you don’t need to figure all this out from scratch. Two years ago, Twitter open-sourced a framework that the company created for its website redesign, and named it Bootstrap. Now in version 3, Bootstrap is the result of thousands of contributions from hundreds of developers. It’s a great starting point for a modern website.</p>
